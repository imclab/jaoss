jaoss (pronounced jay-oss)
==========================

JAOSS (which once upon a time I think stood for Just Another Open Source System)
is a lightweight, fast, object oriented, PHP5, blah blah blah, framework.

Another one?
------------

Yep. Mainly because I could never find one which quite fit *my* needs. Sorry about
that.

How do I use it?
---------------

Short of some proper documentation (one day, I promise...) your best bet is to
probably check out the [jaoss web template](https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-web-template)
which is a bare bones full project skeleton using the jaoss library.

Requirements
------------

PHP >= 5.2
